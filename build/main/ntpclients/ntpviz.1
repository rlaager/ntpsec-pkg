.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This utility analyzes files in an NTP log directory and generates statistical plots from them\&. It can output either PNG images or the gnuplot programs to generate them to standard output\&. In its default mode it generates an HTML directory containing an index page and either (a) all plots, for a single statfiles directory, or (b) a subset of comparative plots for multiple directories\&.
.SS "Basic Options"
.PP
\-d LOGDIR or \-\-datadir LOGDIR
.RS 4
Specifies one or more logfile directories to examine; the default is the single directory /var/log/ntpstats\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g or \-\-generate
.RS 4
Run plot through gnuplot to make png\&. The default is to generate gnuplot programs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-o OUTDIR or \-\-outdir OUTDIR
.RS 4
Set the directory for all output to be OUTDIR\&. If OUTDIR does not exist it is created\&. The default OUTDIR is
\fIntpgraphs\fR\&. Warning: existing PNG files and index\&.html in the output directory will be clobbered\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n STR or \-\-name STR
.RS 4
Set the sitename shown in the plot title, and is effective only for the single\-directory case\&. The default is the basename of the log directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p DAYS or \-\-period DAYS
.RS 4
The default DAYS is for the period of 7 days\&. DAYS can be a floating point number, so "\-p 0\&.5" plots 12 hours\&. DAYS is ignored if \-s and \-e are given\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e TIME or \-\-endtime TIME
.RS 4
With \-s and \-e you set the start and end times\&. TIME is either numeric POSIX time (seconds since the start of the epoch) or ISO 8601\-style timestamps (yyyy\-mmm\-ddThh:mm:ss)\&.

The default end time is the last logfile entry timestamp\&.

The default start time is computed as the end time minus DAYS\&.

Alternatively you can specify either \-s or \-e (but not both) and use \-p to set the plot period in days\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s TIME or \-\-starttime TIME
.RS 4
See \-e and \-p\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c or \-\-clip
.RS 4
Normally all the data is plotted\&. This option limits the range of the plots to the data between 1% and 99%\&. This is useful for ignoring a few spikes in the data\&.
.RE
.PP
\-w SIZE or \-\-width SIZE
.RS 4
Set the size of the output plots\&. SIZE can be one of
\fIs\fR,
\fIm\fR, or
\fIl\fR\&.
\fIs\fR
is for browser on small screens (1024x768)\&.
\fIm\fR
for medium screens (1388x768)\&.
\fIl\fR
for large screens (1920x1080)\&.
\fIm\fR
is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D DLVL or \-\-debug DLVL
.RS 4
Set the debug level to DLVL\&. Larger DLVL leads to more verbosity\&.

0 is the default, quiet except for all ERRORs and some WARNINGs\&.

1 shows some environment info and basic program progress\&.

2 leaves the plot file in the system temp directory\&.

9 is painfully verbose\&. 9 also includes profile data\&.
.RE
.PP
\-N or \-\-nice
.RS 4
Run at the lowest possible priority\&. Only available on UNIX\&.
.RE
.sp
\-V or \-\-version: Print program version and exit\&.
.SS "Individual Plots"
.sp
The plot options choose what graph is generated; invoke only one\&. By default, the gnuplot for the graph is reported; with \-g you get the rendered PNG\&.
.sp
The following plots are available:
.PP
\-\-all\-peer\-jitters
.RS 4
Report all peer jitters\&. This is a different option name from
\-\-peer\-jitters
only because of a limitation in the Python standard library\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-peer\-offsets
.RS 4
Report all peer offsets\&. This is a different option name from
\-\-peer\-offsets
only because of a minor limitation in the Python standard library\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-error
.RS 4
Clock frequency offset from the loop statistics (field 4)
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-freq\-temps
.RS 4
Plot local frequency offset and local temperatures\&. This plot is only generated if there is a log file named temps in the log file directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-jitter
.RS 4
Clock time\-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-gps
.RS 4
Plot GPS Time Dilution of Precision (TDOP) and Number of Sats Used (nSats)\&. This plot is only generated if there is a log file named gpsd in the log file directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-offset
.RS 4
Clock time and clock frequency offsets from the loop statistics (fields 3 and 4)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-offset\-histogram
.RS 4
Frequency histogram of distinct loopstats time offset values (field 3)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-offset\-multiplot
.RS 4
Plot comparative local offsets for multiple directories\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-temps
.RS 4
Plot local temperatures\&. This plot is only generated if there is a log file named temps in the log file directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local\-stability
.RS 4
RMS frequency\-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 6)\&. This is deviation from a root\-mean\-square extrapolation of the moving average of past frequency readings\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-peer\-jitters=host1[,host2\&...]
.RS 4
Peer jitter from local clock time, from peerstats (field 7) A comma\-separated list of peer names must follow\&. It is a fatal error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-peer\-offsets=host1[,host2\&...]
.RS 4
Peer offset from local clock time from peerstats (field 4)\&. A comma\-separated list of peer names or IP addresses must follow\&. It is a fatal error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats\&.
.RE
.sp
If no individual plot is specified, all plots and an index HTML page are generated into the output directory\&.
.sp
When an index is generated, ntpviz will look for two files in the output directory\&. Neither of these files need be present, and the \fIheader\fR and \fIfooter\fR files may contain arbitrary HTML\&.
.sp
The first file is named \fIheader\fR\&. The contents of that file will be added almost at the top of the body on the generated index page\&.
.sp
This is the place to put links to other web pages, or headline notes\&.
.sp
The second file is named \fIfooter\fR\&. The contents of that file will be added almost at the bottom of the body on the generated index\&.
.sp
It is suggested that notes on the server be included in the footer file: OS, versions, CPU speed, etc\&. You may also put links there\&.
.sp
The code includes various sanity checks and will bail out with a message to standard error on, for example, missing logfile data required for a plot\&.
.SS "Argument File"
.sp
Any command line options can also be placed into a command file\&. The command file name (OPTIONFILE) is prefixed on the command line with an atsign (@)\&.
.sp
Each line in the command file should contain just one option\&. Multiple options per line are allowed, but discouraged\&. Blank lines are allowed\&.
.sp
Comments can be added, and start with an octothorpe (#)\&. Comments may appear on a new line, or trailing, after the # \&.
.sp
When an option takes a parameter, the option and parameter must be separated by an equal sign (=) or a space\&.
.sp
These two ways to invoke ntpviz are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ ntpviz \-\-period 1 \-\-outdir day
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ cat day/config
\-\-period=1
\-\-outdir=day
$ ntpviz @day/config
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "REQUIREMENTS"
.sp
Python and gnuplot\&. The plots will look better with the \fIliberation\fR font package installed\&.
.SH "AUTHORS"
.sp
Eric S\&. Raymond, Gary E\&. Miller, and Daniel Drown\&. The gnuplot in this package is largely based on templates in Daniel Drown\(cqs \fIchrony\-graph\fR project: https://github\&.com/ddrown/chrony\-graph/tree/ntpd
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.PP
0
.RS 4
Successful program execution\&.
.RE
.PP
1
.RS 4
The operation failed, usually due to a missing logfile required for a plot\&.
.RE
.PP
2
.RS 4
Illegal command\-line option\&.
.RE
