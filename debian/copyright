Comment: This is not compatible with upstream libisc. The NTPsec lead developer
         says they have made changes to the API.  Here is their comment, from
         libisc/README:
           The code in this directory derives from an old version (91) of
           the ISC export library shipped with BIND9.  Most of the code in that
           library was not needed and has been discarded.

Comment: This is currently used.  The plan is to create a standalone package of
         libjsmn (from the upstream sources).  Then, this package would build
         against that. Note that several other packages in Debian (including
         ntp) currently embed libjsmn.  They could also be fixed to use the
         standalone libjsmn package once it is created.

 .
 As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source
 code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
 portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
 that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
 contributors.
 .
 Specifically, the provision reads:
 .
 "     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
       *    must display the following acknowledgement:
       *    This product includes software developed by the University of

 .
 Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
 include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
 foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
 in its entirety.
