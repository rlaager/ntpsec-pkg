+The +ntpd+ utility can synchronize time to a theoretical precision of

 Ordinarily, +ntpd+ reads the {ntpdconfman} configuration file at startup
 time in order to determine the synchronization sources and operating
 modes. It is also possible to specify a working, although limited,
 configuration entirely on the command line, obviating the need for a
-configuration file. This may be particularly useful when the local host
