Description: systemd: Do not restart
 It is important to specify -g on the command line to allow NTP to correct
 the clock on boot.  However, if Restart=yes is set, a malicious (or broken)
 server could send the incorrect time, trip the panic threshold, and when
 ntpd restarts, serve it the incorrect time (which would be accepted).
