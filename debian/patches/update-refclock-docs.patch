Description: Document disabled refclocks
 The Debian package disables refclocks which were already deprecated when the
 package was initially created.
 
 Also, the modem refclock is disabled. It "requires a Hayes-compatible 1200bps
 modem, hardware now 20 years obsolete".
 
 See also the configure-stamp target in debian/rules.
