Description: Document disabled refclocks
 The Debian package disables refclocks which were already deprecated when the
 package was initially created.
 
 Also, the modem refclock is disabled. It "requires a Hayes-compatible 1200bps
 modem, hardware now 20 years obsolete".
 
 gpsd is a tough call.  It's not deprecated upstream, and it still can work.
 However, upstream recommends the use of SHM, as does every example HOWTO I
 found with a quick search.  Furthermore, it is buggy:
   https://lists.ntpsec.org/pipermail/devel/2016-October/002392.html
 Also, it "makes all sorts of non-standard assumptions about how gpsd is
 configured.  A configuration that is contorted and non-obvious":
   https://lists.ntpsec.org/pipermail/devel/2016-October/002392.html
 Most importantly, it is an attractive nuisance.  If someone is told that the
 best practice is to use "gpsd", they might logically think they should use the
 gpsd driver.

 See the configure step in debian/rules, which specifies the list of refclocks.
