ntpsec (1.1.1+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  To address various bugs, a number of things have been renamed to avoid
  conflicting with the ntp packages.  Most critically, /etc/ntp.conf is now
  at /etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf.  Also, the ntp service has been renamed to ntpsec.
  For systemd, ntp.service is now ntpsec.service.  For sysvinit,
  /etc/init.d/ntp is now /etc/init.d/ntpsec.  This is not an exhaustive list.
