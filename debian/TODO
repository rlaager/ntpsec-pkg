- Rework init script?
  - Create a systemd unit
    - Make it explicitly *not* restart ntpd and document why.
  - Test with suspend/resume on a laptop.
    - We may need:
      [Unit]
      Conflicts=sleep.target
      Before=sleep.target
      + an ntpsec-resume.service unit with:
      [Unit]
      After=systemd-suspend.service systemd-hibernate.service systemd-hybrid-sleep.service
      [Service]
      ExecStart=/bin/systemctl --no-block --fail start ntpsec.service
      [Install]
      WantedBy=sleep.target

  - Test with suspend/resume on a VM.
  - Then, drop all of ntpdate entirely, including the locking in the init
    script.  Move ntpdig to the ntpsec package.

- Peel out Ubuntu changes; test on Jessie. Commit. Upload for experimental.

- Use system libjsmn (which means libjsmn needs packaging)
