- ntpviz
  - Patch it to ignore the non-dated stats* files (i.e. not temps or gpsd)

- Rebase on a new daily tarball

- Document libsodium, libisc, and libjsmn in debian/copyright
  - Probably change it to machine-readable as well
  - Add a Comment that other packages (including ntp) embed libjsmn, though my
    long-term plan is to break it out so we can all use a libjsmn package.

- Peel out Ubuntu changes; test on Jessie. Commit. Upload for experimental.

- Rework init script?
  - For sysvinit, run `ntpd -g`.
  - For systemd, run `ntpd -g` on a service that does *not* restart.
    - Set OnFailure to point to *a second* service that runs `ntpd` and
      *does* restart on failures.
    - This way, if an attacker sends a bad offset, `ntpd -g` will panic, but
      the replacement `ntpd` will not accept bad offsets.
    - OR, just have systemd not restart ntpd either, and run `ntpd -g`.
  - Test with suspend/resume on a laptop.
    - We may need:
      [Unit]
      Conflicts=sleep.target
      Before=sleep.target
      + an ntpsec-resume.service unit with:
      [Unit]
      After=systemd-suspend.service systemd-hibernate.service systemd-hybrid-sleep.service
      [Service]
      ExecStart=/bin/systemctl --no-block --fail start ntpsec.service
      [Install]
      WantedBy=sleep.target
      ---- Discussion here: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=744753
  - Test with suspend/resume on a VM.
  - Then, drop all of ntpdate entirely.  Move ntpdig to the ntpsec package

- Use system libjsmn (which means libjsmn needs packaging)
