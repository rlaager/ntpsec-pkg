== NAME ==
ntpsweep - print various informations about given NTP servers

== SYNOPSIS ==
+ntpsweep+ [+-l+ 'host']... [-p] [+-m+ 'number'] [+-s+ 'prefix'] [+-h+ 'string']

== DESCRIPTION ==

`ntpsweep` prints per host the NTP stratum level, the clock offset in
seconds, the daemon version, the operating system and the processor.
Optionally recursing through all peers.

`ntpsweep` relies on `ntpq` and `ntpdig` to probe servers.  This depends
on the remote host's _restrict_ configuration allowing this.

`ntpsweep` is a perl script, and you may need to run it as:

+perl -I <directory above NTP/Util.pm> ntpsweep+

== OPTIONS ==

+-l+ string, +--host-list+=_string_::
  Host to execute actions on. This option may appear an unlimited number
  of times.
+
Use this option to specify the host on which this script operates. May
appear multiple times.

+-p+, +--peers+::
  Recursively list all peers a host synchronizes to.

+-m+ number, +--maxlevel+=_number_::
  Traverse peers up to this level (4 is a reasonable number). This
  option takes an integer number as its argument.

+-s+ string, +--strip+=_string_::
  Strip this string from hostnames.

+-h+ string, +--host+=_string_::
  Specify a single host.
+
_NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED_

== EXIT STATUS ==

One of the following exit values will be returned:

0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)::
  Successful program execution.
1 (EXIT_FAILURE)::
  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
