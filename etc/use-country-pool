# If you have no other local chimers to help NTP perform sanity checks
# then you can use some public chimers from the NTP public pool:

#
# iburst tells it to send the first few requests at 2 second intervals rather
# than wait for the poll interval which defaults to 64 seconds.  That greatly
# speeds up the time for ntpd to set the system time and start responding to
# requests.
#
# Notice we use the 'us' country code servers, otherwise we might get
# pool servers from opposite sides of the planet accuracy would likely
# be poor.  If you are not in the USA, then it will probably wrk to
# change the 'us' to your two letter country code.

# Major Internet-using countries with pools include:
# us gb de fr ru au at ca cn jp de fi it be br cz hk

# If you don't know your country code, find it at

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1
#
# and then try pinging prepending it to ".pool.ntp.org" and pinging that.
# hostname. If you get a response, you can use it.

# Note: in theory we could use the "pool" keyboard here. There is some
# controvery over whether it is implemented correctly.  One known problem
# (a bug in ntpd) is that it can't be used with restrict nopeer.
