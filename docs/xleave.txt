In the protocol described in the NTP specification and reference
implementation up to now, the transmit timestamp, which is captured
before the message digest is computed and the packet queued for output,
is properly called as a _softstamp_ The receive timestamp, which is
captured after the input driver interrupt routine and before the packet
is queued for input, is properly called a _drivestamp_. For enhanced
accuracy it is desirable to capture the transmit timestamp as close to
the wire as possible; for example, after the output driver interrupt
routine.

In other words, we would like to replace the transmit softstamp with a
drivestamp, but the problem is the transmit drivestamp is available only
after the packet has been sent. A solution for this problem is the
two-step or interleaved protocol described on this page and included in
the current reference implementation. In interleaved modes the
transmit drivestamp for one packet is actually carried in the
immediately following packet. The trick, however, is to implement the
interleaved protocol without changing the NTP packet header format,
without compromising backwards compatibility and without compromising
the error recovery properties.

The reference implementation captures a softstamp before the message
digest routine and a drivestamp after the output interrupt routine. In
this design the latter timestamp can be considered most accurate, as it
avoids the various queuing and transmission latencies. The difference
between the two timestamps, which is called the interleaved or output
delay, varies from 16 &mu;s for a dual-core Pentium running FreeBSD 6.1 to
1100 &mu;s for a Sun Blade 1500 running Solaris 10.

Interleaved mode can be used only in NTP symmetric and broadcast modes.
It is activated by the +xleave+ option with the +peer+ or +broadcast+
configuration commands. A broadcast server configured for interleaved
mode is transparent to ordinary broadcast clients, so both ordinary and
interleaved broadcast clients can use the same packets. An interleaved
symmetric active peer automatically switches to ordinary symmetric mode
if the other peer is not capable of operation in interleaved mode.

As demonstrated in the white paper
{millshome}onwire.html[Analysis and Simulation of
the NTP On-Wire Protocols], the interleaved modes have the same
resistance to lost packets, duplicate packets, packets crossed in flight
and protocol restarts as the ordinary modes. An application of the
interleaved symmetric mode in space missions is presented in the white
paper {millshome}proximity.html[Time
Synchronization for Space Data Links].
