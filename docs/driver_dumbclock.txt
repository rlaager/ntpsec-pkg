= Dumb Clock =

== Synopsis ==

["verse",subs="normal"]
Name: dumbclock
Reference ID: DUMB
Serial Port: /dev/dumbclock_u_; 9600bps 8N1

== Deprecation warning ==

This refclock is deprecated and obsolete. The NTPsec maintainers plan
to remove it in a future release.  If you have a requirement for it,
please make this known to us.

== Description ==

This driver supports a dumb ASCII clock that only emits localtime at a
reliable interval. This has no provisions for leap seconds, quality
codes, etc. It assumes output in the local time zone, and that the C
library mktime()/localtime() routines will correctly convert back and
forth between local and UTC.

Most of this code is originally from refclock_wwvb.c (now
refclock_spectracom.c) with thanks. It has been so mangled that wwvb is
not a recognizable ancestor.
