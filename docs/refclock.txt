[[intro]]
== Introduction ==

{project-shortname} supports a large numberr of satellite, radio and
telephone modem reference clocks plus several audio devices for
instrumentation signals.plus a special pseudo-clock used for backup or
when no other clock source is available.

A general description of the reference clock support is on this
page. Additional information about each reference clock driver can be
found via links from this page. Additional information is on the
link:rdebug.html[Debugging Hints for Reference Clock Drivers] and
link:howto.html[How To Write a Reference Clock Driver] pages.
Information on how to support pulse-per-second (PPS) signals produced by
some devices is on the link:pps.html[Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal
Interfacing] page. All reference clock drivers require that the
reference clock use only Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Timezone and
standard/daylight adjustments are performed by the operating system
kernel.

Nowadays a reference clock will generally (though not always) be a GPS
or GPSDO (GPS-conditioned oscillator). In former times it was often a
radio timecode receiver synchronized to standard time as provided by
NIST and USNO in the US, NRC in Canada and their counterparts
elsewhere in the world.  Precision time radios have been extinct in
the U.S. since NIST changed their signal modulation at
2012-10-29T15:00:00Z; elsewhere they still exist but usage is
declining under pressure from GPS technology.

A device driver specific to each reference clock must be compiled in
the distribution; however, most common GPS, radio, satellite and
telephone modem clocks are included by default and are activated by
configuration commands.  Note that an attempt to configure a reference
clock when the driver has not been compiled or the hardware port has
not been appropriately configured results in a scalding remark to the
system log file, but is otherwise non hazardous.

Reference clocks are supported in the same way as ordinary NTP clients
and use the same filter, select, cluster and combine algorithms. Drivers
have addresses in the form 127.127._t.u_, where _t_ is the driver type
and _u_ is a unit number to distinguish multiple
instances of the same driver. The connection to the computer is device
dependent, usually a serial port, parallel port or special bus
peripheral, but some can work directly from an audio codec or sound
card. The particular device is specified by adding a soft link from the
name used by the driver to the particular device name.

The +server+ command is used to configure a reference clock. Only the
+mode+, +minpoll+, +maxpoll+, and +prefer+ options are supported for
reference clocks, as described on the link:clockopt.html[Reference
Clock Commands] page. The +prefer+ option can be useful to persuade
the server to cherish a reference clock with somewhat more enthusiasm
than other reference clocks or peers. It is further discussed on the
link:prefer.html[Mitigation Rules and the +prefer+ Keyword] page. The
+minpoll+ and +maxpoll+ options have meaning only for selected clock
drivers.

The +fudge+ command is used to provide additional information for
individual clock drivers and normally follows immediately after the
+server+ command. The +address+ argument specifies the clock address.
The +refid+ and +stratum+ options can be used to override the defaults
for the device. There are two optional device-dependent time offsets and
four flags that can be included in the +fudge+ command as well.

The stratum number of a reference clock is by default zero. Since the
{ntpdman} daemon adds one to the stratum of each peer, a primary
server ordinarily displays an external stratum of one. In order to
provide engineered backups, it is often useful to specify the reference
clock stratum as greater than zero. The stratum option is used for this
purpose. Also, in cases involving both a reference clock and a
pulse-per-second (PPS) discipline signal, it is useful to specify the
reference clock identifier as other than the default, depending on the
driver. The refid option is used for this purpose. Except where noted,
these options apply to all clock drivers.


[[spec]]
== Special Considerations ==

The link:audio.html[Audio Drivers] page describes three software drivers
that process audio signals from an audio codec or sound card. One is for
the NIST time and frequency stations WWV and WWVH, another for the
Canadian time and frequency station CHU. These require an external
shortwave radio and antenna. A third is for the generic IRIG signal
produced by some timing devices. Currently, these are supported in
FreeBSD, Solaris and SunOS and likely in other system as well.

The link:driver1.html[Undisciplined Local Clock] driver can
simulate a reference clock when no external synchronization sources are
available. If a server with this driver is connected directly or
indirectly to the public Internet, there is some danger that it can
destabilize other clients. It is not recommended that the local clock
driver be used in this way, as the orphan mode described on the
link:assoc.html[Association Management] page provides a generic backup
capability.

The local clock driver can also be used when an external synchronization
source such as the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol or NIST Lockclock
directly synchronizes the computer time. Further information is on the
link:extern.html[External Clock Discipline and the Local Clock Driver]
page.

Several drivers make use of the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal
discipline, which is part of the generic driver interface, so require no
specific configuration. For those drivers that do not use this
interface, the link:driver22.html[PPS Clock Discipline] driver
can be can provide this function. It normally works in conjunction with
the reference clock that produces the timecode signal, but can work with
another driver or remote server. When PPS kernel features are present,
the driver can redirect the PPS signal to the kernel.

Some drivers depending on longwave or shortwave radio services need to
know the radio propagation time from the transmitter to the receiver.
This must be calculated for each specific receiver location and requires
the geographic coordinates of both the transmitter and receiver. The
transmitter coordinates for various radio services are given in the
{millshome}ntp/qth.html[Time and Frequency
Standard Station Information] page. Receiver coordinates can be obtained
locally or from Google Earth. The actual calculations are beyond the
scope of this document.

Depending on interface type, port speed, etc., a reference clock can
have a small residual offset relative to another. To reduce the effects
of jitter when switching from one driver to the another, it is useful to
calibrate the drivers to a common ensemble offset. The
+enable calibrate+ configuration command described on the
link:miscopt.html[Miscellaneous Options] page activates a special
feature which automatically calculates a correction factor for each
driver relative to an association designated the prefer peer.

[[list]]
== List of Reference Clock Drivers ==

Following is a list showing the type and title of each driver currently
implemented. The default compile-time identifier for each is shown in
under +RefID+. Click on a selected type for specific description and
configuration documentation, including the clock address, reference ID,
driver ID, device name and serial line speed. For those drivers without
specific documentation, please contact the author listed in the
link:copyright.html[Copyright Notice] page.

If you have seen older versions of NTP, this list may have fewer
entries than you expected.  Support for some very ancient drivers
(notably, those rendered obsolete by the WWVB modulation change at
2012-10-29T15:00:00Z) has been dropped in order to reduce our
maintainence load.

For security reasons, we will no longer support any refclock that requires
a closed-source driver to run.  This filtered out the
Datum/Bancomm/Symmetricom bc600-series GPS/IRIG Receiver.
