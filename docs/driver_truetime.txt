Name: truetime
Reference ID: TRUE
Serial Port: +/dev/true+'u'; 9600bps 8N1
Features: +tty_clk+

== Deprecation warning ==

This refclock is deprecated and obsolete. The {project-shortname}
maintainers plan to remove it in a future release.  If you have a
requirement for it, please make this known to us.

== Description ==

This driver supports several models models of Kinemetrics/TrueTime
timing receivers, including 468-DC MK III GOES Synchronized Clock,
GPS- DC MK III and GPS/TM-TMD GPS Synchronized Clock, XL-DC (a
151-602-210, reported by the driver as a GPS/TM-TMD), GPS-800 TCU (an
805-957 with the RS232 Talker/Listener module), and very likely others
in the same model families that use the same timecode formats.

Most of this code is originally from refclock_wwvb.c (now
refclock_spectracom.c) with thanks. It has been so mangled that wwvb is
not a recognizable ancestor.

Quality codes indicate possible error of:

--------------------------------------------------
468-DC GOES Receiver

    ? +/- 500 milliseconds # +/- 50 milliseconds
    * +/- 5 milliseconds . +/- 1 millisecond
    space less than 1 millisecond

== Notes on the 468-DC receiver: ==

Send the clock a +R+ or +C+ and once per second a timestamp will appear.
Send a +R+ to get the satellite position once (GOES only).

Since the old east/west satellite locations are only historical, you
can't set your clock propagation delay settings correctly and still use
automatic mode. The manual says to use a compromise when setting the
switches. This results in significant errors. The solution; use fudges
time1 and time2 to incorporate corrections. If your clock is set for 50
and it should be 58 for using the west and 46 for using the east, use
the options

+time1 +0.008 time2 -0.004+

This corrects the 4 milliseconds advance and 8 milliseconds retard
needed. The software will ask the clock which satellite it sees.

The PCL720 from PC Labs has an Intel 8253 look-alike, as well as a bunch
of TTL input and output pins, all brought out to the back panel. If you
wire a PPS signal (such as the TTL PPS coming out of a GOES or other
Kinemetrics/Truetime clock) to the 8253's GATE0, and then also wire the
8253's OUT0 to the PCL720's INPUT3.BIT0, then we can read CTR0 to get
the number of microseconds since the last PPS upward edge, mediated by
reading OUT0 to find out if the counter has wrapped around (this happens
if more than 65535us (65ms) elapses between the PPS event and our being
called.)

== Notes on the TL-3 receiver: ==

The mini-DIN RS-232 port uses the Apple pinout.

Send the clock ST1 to turn on continuous (1/sec) timecodes. You can
also enable "mode C" via the front panel. ST0 turns off this mode.

QV will return the firmware revision (and is useful in identifying
this clock.)

QW will return its weekly signal log, useful if you're testing
antennas. You may wish to turn the loss interval down from 4h (04) to 1h
(01), so the receiver declares itself unlocked sooner. When in holdover,
drift can be on the order of 10 ms/hr since there is no high quality
reference oscillator.

== Monitor Data ==

When enabled by the +flag4+ option, every received timecode is
written as-is to the +clockstats+ file.

== Driver Options ==

+time1+ 'time'::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
   to be used for the West satellite, with default 0.0.
+time2 time+::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
   to be used for the East satellite, with default 0.0.
+stratum+ 'number'::
   Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 0.
+refid+ 'string'::
   Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one to
   four characters, with default +TRUE+.
+flag1 {0 | 1}+::
   Silence the clock side of {ntpd}, just reading the clock without trying to
   write to it.
+flag2 {0 | 1}+::
   Generate a debug file /tmp/true%d.
+flag3 {0 | 1}+::
   Not used by this driver.
+flag4 {0 | 1}+::
   Enable verbose +clockstats+ recording if set.
+subtype+::
   Not used by this driver.
+mode+::
   Not used by this driver.
+path+ 'filename'::
  Overrides the default device path.
+ppspath+ 'filename'::
  Not used by this driver.
+baud+ 'number'::
  Overrides the default baud rate.
