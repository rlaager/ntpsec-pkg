// Auxilary association commands - included twice 

+manycastserver+ _address..._::
  This command enables reception of manycast client messages to the
  multicast group address(es) (type m) specified. At least one address
  is required, but the NTP multicast address 224.0.1.1 assigned by the
  IANA should NOT be used, unless specific means are taken to limit the
  span of the reply and avoid a possibly massive implosion at the
  original sender. Note that, in order to avoid accidental or malicious
  disruption in this mode, both the server and client should operate
  using authentication as described on the "Authentication Options" page.

+mdnstries+ _number_::
  If we are participating in mDNS, after we have synched for the first
  time we attempt to register with the mDNS system. If that registration
  attempt fails, we try again at one minute intervals for up to
  _number_ times. After all, +ntpd+ may be starting before mDNS. The
  default value for +mdnstries+ is 5.
