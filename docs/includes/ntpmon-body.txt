== Synopsis ==

+ntpmon+ [-a | --all] [-n | --numeric] [-w | --wide] [hostname]

== Description ==

This program is a real-time status monitor for NTP.  It presents the
same information as the 'peers' and 'mrulist' commands of {ntpqman},
but using a split-window display that also includes a status summary
bar, and updates at intervals guaranteed to show status changes as
soon as they occur.

(Specifically, the display begins updating once per second and
adjusts itself to poll at twice the frequency of the shortest
polling interval reported in the last peers response.)

The status bar includes the version string of the server being
watched and the (local) time at which it was last updated).

^C cleanly terminates the program.

== Options ==

Command line options are described following.

+-a+, +--all+::
  Show all hosts, not just reachable ones.
+-n+, +--numeric+::
  Output all host addresses in numeric format rather than
  converting to the canonical host names.
+-w+, +--wide+::
  Wide mode: if the host name or IP Address doesn't fit, write the
  full name/address and indent the next line so columns line up.
  The default truncates the name or address.

If no hostname is specified on the command line, localhost is monitored.

// end
