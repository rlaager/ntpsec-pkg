== SYNOPSIS ==
[verse]
{ntpviz} [-d statsdir] [-g] [-n name] [-p period]
         [-s starttime] [-e endtime]
         [--local-offset | --local-jitter | --local-stability]
         [--peer-offsets=hosts | --all-peer-offsets]
         [--peer-jitters=hosts | --all-peer-jitters]
	 [-o outdir]

== DESCRIPTION ==

This utility analyzes files in an NTP log directory and generates
statistical plots from them.  It can report either PNG images or
the GNUPLOT programs to generate them to standard output.  In its
default mode it generates an HTML directory containing all plots
and an index page.

The most basic option is -d, which specifies a logfile directory to
examine; the default is /var/log/ntpstats.

The -n option allows you to set the sitename shown in the plot title.
The default is the basename of the log directory.

The -s, -e and -p options allow you to set the time window to be
reported on. With -s and -e you set the start and end times as either
numeric POSIX time or ISO8601-style timestamps, -
yyyy-mmm-ddThh:mm:ss. Alternatively you can specify either -s or -e
(but not both) and use -p to set the default period in days.  The
default is for the period to be 7 days, the end time to match the last
logfile entry, and the start time to be set so that adding the period
just reaches the last logfile entry.

The plot options choose what graph is generated; invoke only one.  By
default, the GNUPLOT for the graph is reported; with -g you get the
rendered PNG.

The following plots are available:

--local-offset::
   Clock time and clock frequency offsets from the loop statistics
   (fields 3 and 4).

--local-jitter::
   Clock time-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 5).

--local-stability::
   RMS frequency-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 6).
   This is deviation from a root-mean-square extrapolation of the
   moving average of past frequency readings.

--peer-offsets=host1[,host2...]::
   Peer offset from local clock time from peerstats (field 4). A
   comma-separated list of peer names or IP addresses must follow. It
   is a fatal error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats.

--all-peer-offsets::
   Report all peer offsets.  This is a different option name from
   --peer-offsets only because of a minor limitation in the Python
   standard library.

--peer-jitter=host1[,host2...]::
   Peer jitter from local clock time, from peerstats (field 7)
   A comma-separated list of peer names must follow. It is a fatal
   error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats.

--all-peer-jitters::
   Report all peer jitters.  This is a different option name from
   --peer-offsets only because of a limitation in the Python
   standard library.

--peer-rtt=host::
   Show offset plus or minus round-trip-time (rtt) of a specified
   peer. This graph combines fields 4 and 5 of loopstats.

If no individual plot is specified, all plots and an index HTML page
are generated into a new output directory.  Normally this directory is
named 'ntpgraphs', but the name can be changed with the -o option.
Warning: existing PNG files and index.html in this directory will be
clobbered.

The code includes various sanity checks and will bail out with a message to
standard error on, for example, missing logfile data required for a plot.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

Python and GNUPLOT.  The plots will look better with the 'liberation'
font package installed.

== AUTHORS ==

Eric S. Raymond  and Daniel Drown. The GNUPLOT in this package is
largely based on templates in Daniel Drown's 'chrony-graph' project.
