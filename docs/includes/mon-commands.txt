+statistics+ _name..._::
  Enables writing of statistics records. Currently, eight kinds of
  _name_ statistics are supported.

  +clockstats+;;
    Enables recording of clock driver statistics information. Each
    update received from a clock driver appends a line of the following
    form to the file generation set named _clockstats_:
+
-----------------------------------------------
49213 525.624 127.127.4.1 93 226 00:08:29.606 D
-----------------------------------------------
+
The first two fields show the date (Modified Julian Day) and time
(seconds and fraction past UTC midnight). The next field shows the
clock address in dotted-quad notation. The final field shows the
last timecode received from the clock in decoded ASCII format, where
meaningful. In some clock drivers a good deal of additional
information can be gathered and displayed as well. See information
specific to each clock for further details.

  +cryptostats+;;
    This option requires the OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It
    enables recording of cryptographic public key protocol information.
    Each message received by the protocol module appends a line of the
    following form to the file generation set named _cryptostats_:

  +statsdir+ _directory_path_;;
    Indicates the full path of a directory where statistics files should
    be created (see below). This keyword allows the (otherwise constant)
    _filegen_ filename prefix to be modified for file generation sets,
    which is useful for handling statistics logs.

  +filegen+ _name_ [+file+ _filename_] [+type+ _typename_] [+link+ | +nolink+] [+enable+ | +disable+];;
    Configures setting of generation file set name. Generation file sets
    provide a means for handling files that are continuously growing
    during the lifetime of a server. Server statistics are a typical
    example for such files. Generation file sets provide access to a set
    of files used to store the actual data. At any time at most one
    element of the set is being written to. The type given specifies
    when and how data will be directed to a new element of the set. This
    way, information stored in elements of a file set that are currently
    unused are available for administrative operations without the
    risk of disturbing the operation of {ntpd}. (Most important: they can
    be removed to free space for new data produced.)
+
Note that this command can be sent from the
{ntpqman} program running at a remote location.
+
    +name+::
      This is the type of the statistics records, as shown in the
      _statistics_ command.
    +file+ _filename_::
      This is the file name for the statistics records. Filenames of set
      members are built from three concatenated elements _prefix_,
      _filename_ and _suffix_:

      _prefix_;;
        This is a constant filename path. It is not subject to
        modifications via the _filegen_ option. It is defined by the
        server, usually specified as a compile-time constant. It may,
        however, be configurable for individual file generation sets via
        other commands. For example, the prefix used with _loopstats_
        and _peerstats_ generation can be configured using the
        _statsdir_ option explained above.
      _filename_;;
        This string is directly concatenated to the prefix mentioned
        above (no intervening ‘/’). This can be modified using the file
        argument to the _filegen_ statement. No +..+ elements are
        allowed in this component to prevent filenames referring to
        parts outside the filesystem hierarchy denoted by _prefix_.
      _suffix_;;
        This part is reflects individual elements of a file set. It is
        generated according to the type of a file set.
    +type+ _typename_::
      A file generation set is characterized by its type. The following
      types are supported:

      +none+;;
        The file set is actually a single plain file.
      +pid+;;
        One element of file set is used per incarnation of a {ntpd}
        server. This type does not perform any changes to file set
        members during runtime, however it provides an easy way of
        separating files belonging to different {ntpdman} server
        incarnations. The set member filename is built by appending a
        ‘.’ to concatenated prefix and filename strings, and appending the
        decimal representation of the process ID of the
        {ntpdman} server process.
      +day+;;
        One file generation set element is created per day. A day is
        defined as the period between 00:00 and 24:00 UTC. The file set
        member suffix consists of a ‘.’ and a day specification in the
        form _YYYYMMdd_. _YYYY_ is a 4-digit year number (e.g., 1992).
        _MM_ is a two digit month number. _dd_ is a two digit day
        number. Thus, all information written at 10 December 1992 would
        end up in a file named _prefix_ _filename_.19921210.
      +week+;;
        Any file set member contains data related to a certain week of a
        year. The term week is defined by computing day-of-year modulo 7.
        Elements of such a file generation set are distinguished by
        appending the following suffix to the file set filename base: A
        dot, a 4-digit year number, the letter _W_, and a 2-digit week
        number. For example, information from January, 10th 1992 would
        end up in a file with suffix _1992W1_.
      +month+;;
        One generation file set element is generated per month. The file
        name suffix consists of a dot, a 4-digit year number, and a
        2-digit month.
      +year+;;
        One generation file element is generated per year. The filename
        suffix consists of a dot and a 4 digit year number.
      +age+;;
        This type of file generation sets changes to a new element of
        the file set every 24 hours of server operation. The filename
        suffix consists of a dot, the letter _a_, and an 8-digit number.
        This number is taken to be the number of seconds the server is
        running at the start of the corresponding 24-hour period.

   _link_ | _nolink_::
      It is convenient to be able to access the current element of a
      file generation set by a fixed name. This feature is enabled by
      specifying _link_ and disabled using _nolink_. If link is
      specified, a hard link from the current file set element to a file
      without suffix is created. When there is already a file with this
      name and the number of links of this file is one, it is renamed
      appending a dot, the letter _C_, and the pid of the {ntpd} server
      process. When the number of links is greater than one, the file is
      unlinked. This allows the current file to be accessed by a
      constant name.

  +enable+ | +disable+::
      Enables or disables the recording function.
      Information is only written to a file generation by specifying
      +enable+; output is prevented by specifying +disable+.
