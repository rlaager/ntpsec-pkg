This assumes you have downloaded the source and built a system
and now you want to test your new ntpd.

For help on getting that far, see ../INSTALL


For a one off test:
  Do "ps ax | grep ntpd" or equivalent to find out what the command line is.
  Use whatever you do on your system to stop the normal ntpd.
  Run ./build/ntpd/ntpd plus the command line parameters from above.
  It will daemonize itself and give you back your terminal.

Your current /etc/ntp.conf should work correctly.

Check your log files to see if there is anything strange.
Check ntpq to see if things look normal.

--------

For a longer test, including over reboots...

Install your new code using "./waf install" (as root).
That will install your new ntpd into /usr/local/sbin/ntpd

Now you have to patch your (re)start scripts to look there
and restart ntpd.  The details vary by OS/distro.

Fedora and CentOS using systemd:
  Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service
  Change ExecStart=/usr/sbin/ntpd -u ntp:ntp $OPTIONS
  to     ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/ntpd -u ntp:ntp $OPTIONS
  then   service ntpd restart
    systemctl will barf about an out of date file and tell you
    how to fix it.  Follow its directions and try again.

dnf update may undo that edit and revert to running the system version.


Older versions used /etc/rc.d/init.d/ntpd.
  I put a patch in /etc/sysconfig/ntpd
  It gets sourced so you can put real code in there.
  systemd doesn't do that.
  I inserted:
    PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"


Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian:
  Edit /etc/init.d/ntp
  Change DAEMON=/usr/sbin/ntpd
  to     DAEMON=/usr/local/sbin/ntpd
I duplicate that line, commend out the first one and fixup the second
one so it looks like this:
    # DAEMON=/usr/sbin/ntpd
    DAEMON=/usr/local/sbin/ntpd

If you are using DHCP and your DHCP servers provide NTP servers,
Debian makes a dummy ntp.conf using those servers and not the
ones you put into the normal /etc/ntp.conf.  To use your ntp.conf
rather than the one it wants you to:
  Edit /etc/init.d/ntp
  Comment out the clump of 3 lines that references dhcp:
# if [ -e /var/lib/ntp/ntp.conf.dhcp ]; then
#       NTPD_OPTS="$NTPD_OPTS -c /var/lib/ntp/ntp.conf.dhcp"
# fi

apt-get upgrade may undo those edits and revert to running the system version.


FreeBSD:
  Edit /etc/rc.conf
  It needs to contain
    ntpd_enable="YES"
    ntpd_program="/usr/local/sbin/ntpd"
If you are running ntpd, the first line will be there
already.  The default is NO.


NetBSD:
  Edit /etc/rc.d/ntpd:
  Change: command="/usr/sbin/${name}"
  To:     command="/usr/local/sbin/${name}"
I duplicate the line, comment out the first one and edit the second one.
It looks like this:
  # command="/usr/sbin/${name}"
  command="/usr/local/sbin/${name}"
