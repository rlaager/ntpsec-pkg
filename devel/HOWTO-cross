Cross Compiling
===============

Setup a cross compile environment for your architecture.

Configure NTPSec with:

  waf configure --enable-cross=/path/to/your/cross/cc

There are also --cross-cflags and --cross-ldflags to supply the cross compiler 
with appropriate values.
                                                                  
You will most likely need to install OpenSSL to get crypto support and libevent 
2.x to get ntpdig support.  Out of the box NTPSec will compile with no 
additional dependencies.
