This directory contains code for data reduction and visualization of NTP
logfiles.  It's written around a class named NTPstats, which can be found
in ntpstats.py.

While all comers are invited to experiment with ntpstats.py, its interface
and capabilities are at present private to the NTPsec suite, subject to
change without notice, and should not be considered a public interface.
This status may (and probably will) change in a future release.

If you want to generate the ntpviz graphs regularly, add these lines to
your root crontab:

53 * * * * cd /usr/local/src/NTP/ntpsec/ntpstats; ./ntpviz -p 1 -o day
45 11,23 * * * cd /usr/local/src/NTP/ntpsec/ntpstats; ./ntpviz -p 7 -o week
