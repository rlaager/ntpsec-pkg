This directory contains code for deta reduction and visualization of NTP
logfiles.  It's written around a class named NTPstats which can be found
in ntpstats.py.

While all comers are invited to experiment with ntpstats.py, its interface
and capabilities are at present private to the NTPsec suite, subject to
change without notice, and should not be considered a public interface.
This status may (and probably will) change in a future release.
