to get the CPU temperature and write the temperatures to stdout.  Useful
to create a log that can be used by 'ntpviz --local-temps'

smartctl-temp-log for hard drives.  It is a tool to read a hard drive's
SMART data to get the disk temperature and write the temperature
to stdout.  Useful to create a log that can be used by 'ntpviz
--local-temps'
